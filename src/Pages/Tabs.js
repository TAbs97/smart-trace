          Smart Trace is an advanced innovative system that is built to help
          fight crime.
          The system is centralized across various systems in our daily lives
          ones that deals with ecommerce, What the system does is that it
          prevents stolen electronic goods(smartphones, tablets, computers...)
          or any valuable.
          Possessions from being sold online without the owner knowing about
          it/consentual agreement.
          The complete system includes a web application and a mobile
          application which users can download and register.
          their acoounts with all their possessions underneath.
          We are proud to say that the system is flexible enough to let users
          manage their own possessions online.
          without any second party interfering with their accounts and
          possessions.
          The system is linked to the SAPS who are investigating on stolen goods
          that are reported with a valid case number.
          There is more to our system than what we've already mentioned.
